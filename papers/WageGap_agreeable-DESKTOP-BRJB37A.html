           In this paper, we apply the insights gathered from a review of the psychology literature and laboratory experiments to study the gender wage gap found in labor economics. Specifically, we use individual difference in agreeableness to explain the gender wage gap among recent graduates in China. Past studies suggested that agreeableness negatively correlates with income, as people who are decent and friendly tend to be outmaneuvered or overwhelmed by others who are not. Yet in the current paper, we find the opposite relationship by looking at people’s starting salaries. In general more agreeable person can get higher starting salaries. This effect is independent from one’s occupation. In addition, we find that agreeable men receive more benefits than agreeable women.  Such difference can partially explain the gender wage gap among the recent graduates. We conjecture that the employers’ preference in the job-seekers may results in these observed phenomena. The findings of this study provide insights that can help economists better understand the gender wage gap and the search-and-matching mechanism on the labor market.
