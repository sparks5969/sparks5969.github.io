          Identifying heterogeneous decision-making rules is of fundamental importance in social science research. In this paper, we introduce a data-driven method to capture individual’s unique behavioral pattern in social dilemma experiments. The principal idea of the method is that a person’s strategy profile—a reliable tendency of how one makes decisions in interactive settings— should be revealed by analyzing a series of observed decisions. We demonstrate this revealed-strategy approach in a repeated public goods game. Using unsupervised machine learning, we classify participants’ dynamic behaviors into five distinctive and stable strategy profiles, which are free-riders, strong cooperators, lower-than-signal cooperators, higher-than-signal cooperators, and hump-shaped cooperators. Hump-shaped cooperation, previously only found as expressed preference in one-shot games, were first identified in repeated games using the revealed-strategy approach. In two simulations, we show that policies utilizing how conditional cooperators respond to the norm can effectively promote cooperation. We encourage future research to extend the revealed-strategy approach to quantify and understand the heterogeneous mixture in diverse contexts.
