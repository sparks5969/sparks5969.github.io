        <p>
          This study examines how a decision-maker's subjective belief is determined by her risk preference in a coordination game. We conduct a laboratory experiment where the participants played a repeated, fixed partner stag-hunt game. In the experiment, we elicited the participants' subjective belief, risk aversion and cautiousness levels. Here, we confirm the findings from past studies that suggest that the traditional measure of risk aversion in economics cannot explain people's behavior. Additionally, we find that the psychological concept of cautiousness plays a key role in determining the origin and the evolution of the decision-maker's belief. Specifically, we find that cautiousness affects the way people form the mental representation of their partners. A decisionmaker with a higher cautiousness level is less likely to believe that her partner will choose the risky option. When the stag-hunt game was played repeatedly, a high cautiousness level prevents the decision maker from updating her belief effectively, and consequently impedes cooperation between the players.
