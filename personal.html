        I'm currently a postdoctoral scholar at <a href="https://case.edu/" target=_blank>Case Western Reserve University</a>, department of economics, with a joint appointment at <a href="https://www.unifylabs.org/" target=_blank>The Unify Labs</a> as computational economist and lead data scientist. My research interests are in computational economics, behavioral economics, and game theory. A central focus of my work is to bridge economics, psychology, and data science, use game theory and quantitative methods to investigate why people make decisions in varied ways and how different social outcomes are achieved in interactive settings.

        <p>
        Before joining CWRU and the Unify Labs, I was a post-doc scholar at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>, department of economics and the big data research lab. I received my Ph.D. degree from the <a href='https://uconn.edu/'>University of Connecticut</a>, department of economics. Prior to my Ph.D. degree, I received my B.S. degree from the School of Finance at the <a href="https://www.ruc.edu.cn/">Renmin University of China</a>.

        I was born and grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing" target=_blank>Beijing</a> (39.9167° N, 116.3833° E), the current (and also the ancient) capital of China. I have an irrational enthusiasm for football (known as soccer at other places on the planet). My favorite clubs are Guo’an FC (my hometown club) and Liverpool FC. I love Chinese food. Cooking for families and friends is always a fun event for me. I also like movies, especially anything starring Al Pacino. I try not to play with reptiles.

        My childhood “dream careers” were (in chronological order): firefighter, bandleader, civil engineer, tour guide, professional soccer player, and magician. After much exploration, I found a sense of purpose in academia. Academic life gives me two pleasures -- learning and sharing. I first learn from textbooks, the literature, experiments and my students. Then, I share my ideas and opinions with others, indeed with anyone who likes to discuss ideas.
