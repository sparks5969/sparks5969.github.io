        I am a post-doctoral research fellow at the University of Waterloo, Department of Economics. I received my Ph.D. degree from the University of Connecitcut and my B.S. degree from the School of Finance at the Renmin University of China. My research is in behavioral and experimental economics. In my work I try to bring psychological insights to bear on models central to game theory and individual decision making.

        I was born and grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing" target=_blank>Beijing</a> (39.9167° N, 116.3833° E), the current (and also the ancient) capital of China. I have an irrational enthusiasm for football (known as soccer at other places on the planet). My favorite clubs are Guo’an FC (my hometown club) and Liverpool FC. I love Chinese food. Cooking for families and friends is always a fun event for me. I also like movies, especially anything starring Al Pacino. I try not to play with reptiles.

        My childhood “dream careers” were (in chronological order): firefighter, bandleader, civil engineer, tour guide, professional soccer player, and magician. After much exploration, I found a sense of purpose in academia. Academic life gives me two pleasures -- learning and sharing. I first learn from textbooks, the literature, experiments and my students. Then, I share my ideas and opinions with others, indeed with anyone who likes to discuss ideas.  For more details about my professional background, please see my <a href="vita.html" style=color:#FF7519>vita</a>, <a href="research.html" style=color:#FF7519>research</a>, or <a href="teaching.html" style=color:#FF7519>teaching page</a>.
